		CHANGES IN FLCore VERSION 1.4

NEW FEATURES
	o	new computeCatch method for FLIndex
	o	new bkey method to build keys for bubble plots.
	o	new tofrm method to provide formulas based on FLQuant objects.
    o   new trim method for FLIndex objects.
    o   the square bracket operator '[' has been overloaded for FLIndices and 
        FLQuants. An object of the same class is now returned.
    o   bubbles("FLQuants")
        - Lattice-based plot of negative and positive values with different colors. 
    o   mcf("list")
        - New method to create FLQuants objects where all FLQuant objects dimensions are the 
          same. 
    o   new method data.list("list")
        - Creates a data.frame from an FLQuants with the FLQuant objects rbinded. 
    o   the square bracket operators '[' and '[<-' are now available for FLStock. Value given
        in the second case must be of class FLStock too.
	o	lapply defined for FLIndex and FLIndices	o	lapply defined for FLIndex and FLIndices

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o   summary for FLQuant now returns information about the distribution of values in
	o type and type<- are now defined for FLIndex
        the data, instead of being a replicate of dimnames().
	o	A print() method for FLQuant has been added to match show()

BUG FIXES
    o   data.list was giving warning when "age" was numeric, now it coerces all into character 
    o   calls to seq() in transform and apply methods for FLIndex have been corrected
    o   Indices of type ICA were not correctly loaded if more than one index was present
        in the file
	o   bubbles(FLQuants) was not ploting correctly, fixed now.
    o   as.FLQuant(data.frame) would fail if the input object was missing a column. Missing
        columns (dimensions) are now filled up with the standard values.
    o   The FLQuant method now respects dimnames of input 2D arrays
